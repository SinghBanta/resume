    <h1>About Section </h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Banta Singh, a dedicated student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at IKGPTU. With a strong foundation in Python and a passion for technology, I'm on a journey to become an AI and Robotics engineer. My academic journey is set to culminate in 2025, and I'm eager to contribute to the exciting world of artificial intelligence and robotics.

        <p>My love for cricket extends beyond the pitch, where I've learned the values of teamwork, perseverance, and a competitive spiritâ€”values that I carry with me into my academic and professional pursuits.</p> 
        
        I'm constantly exploring new technologies and seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. If you're interested in connecting, discussing technology, cricket, or anything else, feel free to reach out. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together!</p>
